# Genetic Optimization for function

Simple project using R to showcase genetic algorithms to find the optima of custom math functions (+ their graphs).

## TODO List

- [X] R script + genetic algorithm for custom functions.
- [X] Implement selecting different crossover methods.
- [X] Implement selecting different mutation methods.
- [X] Implement selecting different selection methods.
- [] Support for more advanced functions (with 3D graphs e.t.c)
  - [ ] Plotly for 3D charts
